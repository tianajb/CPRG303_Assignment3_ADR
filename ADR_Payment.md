# ADR: Payment

**Status**

Proposed

**Context**

A secure, trusted, and safe payment gateway should be selected to enable the app to securely process a payment transaction. It should be able to support Android and Apple devices and should support different regions to prepare for further expansions.

**Decision**

Considering Stripe as the main payment gateway for the app because of its support to different type of credit and debit cards and digital wallets. But although Stripe could be the best choice for this application, the developers would like to further study other options before finalizing the selection.

**Consequences**

Using a payment gateway that could support different types of payments would offer the users a flexible payment method.
