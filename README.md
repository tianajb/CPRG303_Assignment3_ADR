**Scenario 3**

You are a mobile app development team tasked with creating a new app for a client. The app will allow users to order food from local restaurants for delivery or pickup. Users must be able to create an account and save their payment information for future orders. The app must have a user-friendly interface that is easy to navigate and allows for seamless ordering. The following requirements must be considered:
1.	The app needs to track the user's location to provide accurate restaurant recommendations, estimate delivery times, and display nearby options. The team should decide on an approach for location tracking, such as utilizing GPS capabilities or integrating with location-based services.
2.	To enhance the user experience, the app should provide real-time order tracking, allowing users to monitor the status and progress of their orders. The team needs to determine the architecture and technology stack for implementing real-time updates.
3.	The app requires integration with various payment gateways to facilitate secure and seamless transactions. The team should evaluate different payment gateway options, considering factors such as security, user experience, supported regions, and transaction fees.
4.	To ensure accurate and up-to-date restaurant menus, the app should integrate with the restaurants' inventory management systems. The team needs to determine the most efficient and reliable method of synchronizing menu data, such as through APIs or web scraping techniques.
5.	To help users make informed decisions, the app should include a feature for users to leave reviews and ratings for restaurants and food items. The team needs to design and implement a system for collecting, displaying, and moderating user-generated content.
6.	The app should provide users with access to their order history, allowing them to easily reorder their favorite items. The team needs to decide on the data storage and retrieval mechanisms to efficiently manage and display order history.
7.	To keep users informed about order confirmations, delivery updates, and promotional offers, the app should include a notification system. The team needs to determine the architecture and integration approach for sending and managing push notifications.
